Topologically-Informed Neural Networks for Predictive Modeling in Complex Biological Systems

Welcome to Team → Poster Breaker's GitHub repository! This project was created as part of a poster presentation exploring how topological data analysis (TDA) can be used with neural networks to understand biological systems more effectively.

 Introduction

Biological systems like gene networks and disease progressions are highly complex. Traditional AI models struggle to understand these patterns. This project introduces a neural network that uses topological data analysis to process gene expression data and make predictions about diseases.

 Motivation :

Shapes in biological data matter a lot—especially in how genes behave. By analyzing those patterns using topological structures, we aim to detect diseases earlier and more accurately. This method bridges biology with geometry and AI.

Methodology :

We used gene expression data from real biological samples.

Our model identifies which genes are active and how strongly.

A graph is generated from this data, where patterns and shapes indicate potential diseases.

For example:

Cancer-related data often shows scattered/branched shapes.

Viral data may produce compact or circular shapes.



Results:

Improved cancer classification accuracy

Detected disease patterns earlier

Made reliable predictions from gene activity shapes


Conclusion

Our model combines mathematical theory with biomedical applications. By identifying unique shapes in gene expression data, it helps detect diseases more efficiently than traditional methods.
